# 🖊️ MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

📌 Project Overview

The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification project is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9) using Neural Networks. This project leverages the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

Using Deep Learning and Neural Networks, the model is trained to accurately predict digits from handwritten inputs.
