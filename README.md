# üñäÔ∏è MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification  

## üìå Project Overview  
The **MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification** project leverages deep learning to recognize and classify handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from the well-known **MNIST dataset**.  

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of:  
- Loading and preprocessing image data  
- Building, training, and evaluating a neural network  
- Saving the trained model for inference  
- Using the model to predict handwritten digits from uploaded images  

This project serves as an excellent foundation for learning computer vision, neural networks, and practical model deployment.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Guidelines  

1. **Training the Model**  
   - Open the notebook `MNSIT_Handwritten_Digit_Classification.ipynb`.  
   - Run all cells to train the model on the MNIST dataset.  
   - The model will be evaluated on the test dataset with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.  

2. **Testing with Custom Images**  
   - Place your handwritten digit images in the project directory.  
   - Update the file path in the notebook (or script) to test predictions.  
   - The system will preprocess the image (resize, grayscale, normalize) and predict the digit.  

3. **Model Saving & Loading**  
   - After training, save the model using:  
     ```python
     model.save('mnist_model.keras')
     ```  
   - Reload it later for inference:  
     ```python
     from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
     model = load_model('mnist_model.keras')
     ```

4. **Expected Output**  
   - Predicted digit label (0‚Äì9).  
   - Confidence scores for each class.  
   - Visualization of the input image and predicted result.
